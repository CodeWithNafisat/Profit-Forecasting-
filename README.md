# Profit-Forecasting-
Problem Statement & Objective

Problem:
Businesses and policymakers often struggle with predicting retail and food service sales due to fluctuating demand, seasonal patterns (e.g., holidays), and long-term economic trends. Traditional spreadsheets make forecasting manual, error-prone, and difficult to visualize.

Objective:
  1. This project leverages machine learning and interactive dashboards to:
  
  2. Automate monthly sales forecasting for the next 1‚Äì36 months.
  
  3. Visualize trends and seasonality in retail & food services data.
  
  4. Allow users to download forecast results in CSV format.
  
  5. Provide a simple, interactive interface for business decision-making.

Step-by-Step Setup Instructions

  1. Download or clone the repository from GitHub.
  
  2. Install the required Python libraries listed in the requirements file (Streamlit, Prophet, Pandas, Plotly, Joblib).
  
  3. Make sure the pre-trained model file (Us_Retail_Sales.pkl) is available in the project folder.
  
  4. Start the Streamlit app by running the main script.
  
  5. Open your browser at the local Streamlit address (usually http://localhost:8501/).

Usage Guide & Examples

 . Use the sidebar slider to choose how many months (1‚Äì36) you want to forecast.
